Key Racer follows industry-standard security practices:

### Authentication & Authorization
- **JWT-based authentication** with secure token handling
- **bcrypt password hashing** with salt rounds
- **OAuth 2.0 integration** with Google for secure third-party login
- **Session management** with secure cookies
- **Role-based access control** for different user types

### Data Protection
- **Input validation** and sanitization on all user inputs
- **SQL injection prevention** through parameterized queries
- **XSS protection** with content security policies
- **CSRF protection** with secure tokens
- **Data encryption** in transit and at rest

### Infrastructure Security
- **HTTPS enforcement** for all production traffic
- **Security headers** implemented via Helmet.js
- **Rate limiting** to prevent abuse and DDoS
- **CORS configuration** for secure cross-origin requests
- **Environment variable protection** for sensitive data

### How to Report

1. **Email**: Send details to security@keyracer.in
2. **Subject**: Use format "SECURITY: Brief description"
3. **Encryption**: Use our PGP key for sensitive information
4. **Details**: Include as much information as possible

### What to Include

- **Affected components** (URLs, parameters, code sections)
- **Steps to reproduce** the vulnerability
- **Potential impact** and severity assessment
- **Suggested fix** (if you have one)
- **Your contact information** for follow-up

### Response Timeline

| Timeline | Action |
|----------|--------|

| 72 hours | Vulnerability assessment and triage |
| 7 days   | Detailed response with fix timeline |
| 30 days  | Security patch released (if applicable) |

## 🔍 Security Assessment

### Vulnerability Scoring

We use the [CVSS 3.1](https://www.first.org/cvss/) framework for vulnerability scoring:

- **Critical (9.0-10.0)**: Immediate attention required
- **High (7.0-8.9)**: Fix within 7 days
- **Medium (4.0-6.9)**: Fix within 30 days
- **Low (0.1-3.9)**: Fix in next regular release

### Scope

This security policy covers:
- ✅ Key Racer web application
- ✅ API endpoints and services
- ✅ Authentication and authorization systems
- ✅ Database and data handling
- ✅ Third-party integrations

This policy does not cover:
- ❌ Third-party services (Google OAuth, MongoDB Atlas)
- ❌ User's local environment or browser
- ❌ Social engineering attacks
- ❌ Physical security

## 🛠️ Security Best Practices

### For Developers

#### Code Security
```javascript
// ✅ Good: Parameterized queries
const user = await User.findOne({ email: sanitize(email) });

// ❌ Bad: Direct string concatenation
const query = "SELECT * FROM users WHERE email = '" + email + "'";
```

#### Environment Variables
```javascript
// ✅ Good: Use environment variables
const jwtSecret = process.env.JWT_SECRET;

// ❌ Bad: Hardcoded secrets
const jwtSecret = "hardcoded_secret_key";
```

#### Input Validation
```javascript
// ✅ Good: Validate and sanitize input
const email = validator.isEmail(req.body.email) ? req.body.email : null;

// ❌ Bad: Trust user input
const email = req.body.email;
```

### For Administrators

#### Server Configuration
- Use HTTPS with valid SSL certificates
- Keep Node.js and dependencies updated
- Configure firewalls and access controls
- Enable security monitoring and logging
- Regular security audits and penetration testing

#### Database Security
- Use strong authentication credentials
- Enable MongoDB authentication
- Restrict database access by IP
- Regular database backups with encryption
- Monitor for suspicious database activity

## 🔐 Security Features
