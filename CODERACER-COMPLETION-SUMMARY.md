### **API Endpoints**
```
GET  /api/leaderboard              # Get rankings with filters
GET  /api/leaderboard/user/:id/position  # User position
GET  /api/challenges               # List challenges
GET  /api/challenges/:id           # Challenge details
POST /api/challenges/:id/submit    # Submit solution
GET  /api/challenges/user/:id/progress    # User progress
```

### **Scoring Formula**
```
Base Points = Difficulty Points (10-100)
Time Bonus = Top 10% (+50%), Top 25% (+25%), Top 50% (+10%)
Attempt Penalty = 1st (+100%), 2nd (-10%), 3rd (-20%), 4+ (-30%)
Streak Bonus = 3-day (+10pts), 7-day (+30pts), 30-day (+100pts)
Final Score = (Base × Time Bonus × Attempt Multiplier × Accuracy) + Streak Bonus
```
